This is simple, yet satisfying game made with raylib. The main idea of this game is to experiment with physics and interactions of different materials.    

### What game offers in the current state?  
1. 16 different materials, some of which have some kind of interaction or functionality.
2. Fire physics(try to ignite something)
3. Simple density physics
4. Simple viscousity physics
5. Temperature physics(Right now works only to ignite something from lava)

### How to play 
1. You can use Sandbox.exe to run it or Sandbox Unix executable if you run it on mac.
2. If you want to modify the game you can use VS code.
     1. Enter the game directory
     2. Click on "main.code-workspace" file and click "Open Workspace".
