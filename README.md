This is simple, yet satisfying game made with raylib. The main idea of this game is to experiment with physics and interactions of different materials.    

### What game offers in the current state?  
1. 16 different materials, the majority of which have some kind of interaction or functionality.
2. Fire physics (try to ignite something)
3. Simple density physics
4. Simple viscosity physics
5. Temperature physics (Right now works only to ignite something with lava)

### How to play 
1. You can use Sandbox.exe to run it or Sandbox Unix executable if you run it on mac.  
&emsp; Note: You can simply download the executable, as it doesn't depend on external files.
3. If you want to modify the game you can use VS code.
     1. Open the game directory
     2. Open the "main.code-workspace" file and select "Open Workspace".
     3. Open main.cpp and press F5 (or Fn + F5 on Mac) to run the game.
